# Defend the Frontier

Welcome to our game, Defend the Frontier!

See how long you can survive the dangerous onslaught of enemies using only your trusty gun and some advanced trajectory-calculating intellect.

Kill more enemies to score more points, but don’t run into them or the edges or you’ll die!

Practice your creativity and ingenuity as you try to kill enemies without killing yourself!
